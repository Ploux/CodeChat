Examples
========
Some examples of literate programming using CodeChat:

*   Use of a ``toctree`` directive to categorize all source files in `CodeChat itself <http://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-toctree.html>`_.
*   Use of tables to help design a `simple parser <http://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CodeChat/CodeToRest.py.html#step-5-of-lexer-to-rest>`_.
*   Use of a numbered list to explain a `simple state machine <http://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CodeChat/CodeToRest.py.html#summary-and-implementation>`_.
*   Use of hyperlinks to provide reference information for all `Sphinx configuration values <http://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf.py.html>`_.
*   Use of fonts to show what ``setup.py`` `commands to run <http://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.py.html>`_.
*   `Documentation <https://pyinstaller-sample-hook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for integrating a PyInstaller hook into a distribution.
*   Code examples in a course on `microprocessors <http://www.ece.msstate.edu/courses/ece3724/main_pic24/docs/sphinx/textbook_examples.html>`_.
